# Quantum Computing with Cirq

Welcome to the "Quantum Computing with Cirq" repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks and HTML documents serves as a comprehensive guide to quantum computing using the Cirq framework.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of notebooks that cover various aspects of quantum computing. The content is organized into two main sections: **Basic Concepts and Foundations** and **Advanced Protocols and Algorithms**. Each notebook provides detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to help you understand and experiment with quantum computing principles.
